As a user, I want to be able to :

Create an account
Change my password
Write a post about my trips
View all my posts/stories in one place
Edit any of my posts
Delete any of my posts


For wireframes, go to public/wireframes

My project is a social network where users can post about their trip experiences. Each user on the platform can post but a user can only edit/delete a post they created.
